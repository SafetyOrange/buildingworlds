Building Worlds
==============

This is a repo for "Building Worlds," a project-engineering / world building class at Parsons the New School for Design in NYC. It's an introductory-level class that tries to combine 3D world building, engine pipelines, software engineering patterns, architectural theory, and project management / processes -- with a video game development focus, though it's intended to be applicable to any field. (e.g. interaction design, sound design, animation, illustration, etc.)

As a studio elective for people with little or no experience in code or game development, these projects emphasize process over result.

Spring 2013 focuses on using Unity3D. Future semesters may use Polycode instead.
